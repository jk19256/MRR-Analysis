# MRR-Analysis
The main idea behind this task is to calculate MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) from the data collected. The main excel file contain two sheets: sales data and license data. 

1. MRR Calculation Strategy:
- We first tried to understand what are the main parameters in both sheets that may influence the MRR output.
- We calculated the monthly MRR.
1.3. We calculated the annual dependent MRR after dividing the annual sales over the number of months.
1.4. We summed both monthly indexed MRR and annual-based indexed MRR together.
1.5. By that we managed to calculate MRR.
1.6. Please note that we assumed that the purchase price in the sales data sheet is the total price per a sale transaction, and it is not the unit price.

2. Observations:
2.1. MRR was peak on January 2019, approximately $14,133. Then MRR dropped significantly after February 2019.
2.2. The license data sheet did not have any influence on calculating the MRR.
2.3. The MRR represented by this data occurred between February 2017 and January 2022.
2.4. The highest MoM (Month over Month) MRR growth was 344.3%, that happened between February to March of 2017.
2.5. The highest QoQ (Quarter over Quarter) MRR growth was 99.1%, that happened between Q3 to Q4 of 2017.
